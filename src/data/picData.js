        text: '<p><em>kabuki</em> - from kabuku, verb, to lean or to be out of the ordinary</p><p>Before kabuki became the seen-and-be-seen, bourgeoisie matinee outing it is today, the 17th century theatrical form was a red-light thrill. Loud and erotic, it provided prostitutes and aristocrats a shared experience of adulterated surreality. Its stories have flattened, but in its path from lowbrow to high art, the practice has managed to keep its original rawness in a unique way: through kakegoe, formalized heckling.</p><p>Its practitioners are members of an elite and exclusive guild. They’ve trained themselves to sense precisely when to cry out during a warrior’s epic pose, <em>“Iro otoko!”</em> (“Sexy fellow!”) and how to bless the ancestors following a brilliantly delivered monologue: <em>“Otosan to sokkuri!”</em> (“Exactly like your father!”).</p><p>Theatergoers leave it to the professionals to mark the moments of charged contradiction — when the regal kneels before the bawdy, the elegant nods to the grotesque, and tradition locks lips with modernity in unabashed glee. Japan navigates these uncanny valleys more artfully than just about anywhere else I’ve traveled. Its artists know how to capture the spirits scared up on those sojourns and build them super cute altars, fit to become wonders of the world. The inspiration was constant and demanding. The poems flowed; Alycia was flicking her camera around in every helix imaginable. And I started to see these pieces as delivering the same kind of bewildering reverence — interjections, offerings, commentary, our own kakegoe in Nippon’s daily drama.</p><p><em>“Tento sama!”</em> (“Light of my life!”)</p><p>TB & AK</p>'
